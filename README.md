# OSSU 
 
Programs I wrote completing [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) courses

[How to Code - Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x) and [How to Code - Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-complex-data-ubcx-htc2x) *.rkt programs can be viewed and ran with [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org/). Programs that don't make use of Racket's powerful image creation and manipulation are also implemented in Python from scratch
